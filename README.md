# kinterpreter

A Clojure based interpreter for the esolang (Kipple)[https://esolangs.org/wiki/Kipple].

### Aside

This is the first time I have _ever_ made something like an interpreter.  The commits you see will be like snapshots for my learning process.
I understand that Kipple is a fairly simple, stack based, esolang but one has to start somewhere. `:)`

## Usage

Use `java -jar kips.jar [path-to-file].k`
